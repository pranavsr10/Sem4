Path Setting
	---Where ever may be the location of a file, by path setting we could view or execute it from your current directory.
	---for example i have a file in home/user/Desktop/sample.txt, currently im in home directory,i could open the sample.txt from home directory using path setting.
	
	Two ways:
	 --Permenatly setting the path
	 --Temperory
	 
	 
	 --Permenant:
	 	 * export PATH "$PATH:/--location of the file which we need to execute it in any of the directories--"
	 	 * this is the syntax of path setting,this line of code should be added to the .bashrc file .
	 	 
		example:
			export PATH="$PATH:/home/Pranav/.bin"
		
	  --Temporary:
	  	* set PATH "--location of the file which we need to execute it in any of the directories--"
	  	* this can be typed in any part of the terminal and this path setting will be there until we are closing the terminal
	  	
	  	example:
	  		set PATH="$PATH:/home/Pranav/Desktop".
